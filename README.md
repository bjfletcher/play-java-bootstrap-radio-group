A demonstration of using vanilla Bootstrap (`bootstrap.css` included in `main.scala.html`) and Play's form framework for a radio group.

This is the Java version of Play. There is a [Scala version](https://github.com/bjfletcher/play-bootstrap-radio-group) of this same demonstration.

A screenshot of the result:
